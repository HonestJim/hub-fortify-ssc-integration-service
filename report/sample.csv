The issue is due to the block cipher padding not being deterministic and not covered by the MAC (Message Authentication Code). By sending a number of crafted requests to the server, an attacker can induce requests that will allow determining plaintext chunks of data. When used in an automated fashion, this can be used to determine a considerable amount of encrypted traffic, allowing a man-in-the-middle attacker to gain access to the plaintext data stream.",2014-10-14,2017-05-18,3.5,6.8,2.9,VULNDB,NEW,,,,,LOW,"2017-05-22 09:00:13.467"
